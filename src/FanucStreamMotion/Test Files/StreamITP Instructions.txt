To use the new program, type:

   StreamITP <pos filename> <ip address> <joint/Cartesian> <joint num for jerk threshold>

    The 3rd argument (joint) indicates the data in the dataFileName are in joint angles. If you want to use Cartesian, change the joint to Cartesian.
    The 4th argument indicates the you want the PC program to print out J1 jerk threshold. You can change 1 to 2 - 6 to get jerk threshold from J2-J6.
	However, one joint at a time.

    Arguments 3 & 4 are optional, if you donâ€™t type in these arguments, the default is reading joint angle and no threshold limit reading.

Examples:
	StreamITP curang.txt 127.0.0.2			-- Joint rep, no jerk limits printed
	StreamITP curang.txt 127.0.0.2 Joint 3		-- Joint rep, J3 jerk limits printed
	StreamITP curang.txt 127.0.0.2 Cartesian	-- Cartesian rep, no jerk limit printed
